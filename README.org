This lets me declare 2D matrices as slices.
It allocates all the space for data as one lump and puts it in fullData which is not exported.
It then allocates a slices of slices ands sets up the indexing.

Normally you say
#+BEGIN_SRC C
 m := newFMatrix2c (n_r, n_c)
#+END_SRC
where src_C[:exports code]{n_r} and src_C[:exports code]{n_c} are the number of rows and columns respectively.
But to access elements like a matrix, you need to say src_C[:exports code]{m.Mat[i][j]} to get to elements =i= and =j=.

We need to have different functions for different types, so src_go[:exports code]{newFMatrix(n, m)} gives us a float32 matrix, but src_go[:exports code]{newBMatrix} gives a boolean matrix.
